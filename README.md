# AI_Resources

The title says it all! This document is a running wiki on the various facets of artifical intelligence. The easiest way to demystify a topic is by breaking it down to its subcomponents and investigating its fundamental features (fun fact: similar to a convolutional layer ;D). This document is my attempt (and hopefully others, through crowdsourcing efforts) at outlining the toolkit that accompanies artificial intelligence applications. Interestingly, the categories range from statistical mathematics and deep learning frameworks all the way to psychology-based literature and layman media articles. I hope this interdisciplinary nature of AI becomes a testament to how a diverse and creative experience it can be for you. Likewise, hopefully this wiki will kickstart your AI endeavours and help you gradually reveal its interdisciplinary beauty!
